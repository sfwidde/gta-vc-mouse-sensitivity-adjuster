# Mouse sensitivity adjuster for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
This modification allows user to freely modify their Vice City's mouse
sensitivity, specially vertical (y-axis) sensitivity which is unbalanced in
Vice City.
Please bear in mind this mod was specially made for Vice City: Multiplayer
(VC:MP) 0.4 players who wish to play VC:MP 0.3z R2 (or earlier versions) with
their current 0.4 sensitivity settings. This doesn't mean, however, that the
mod is limited to be used by VC:MP players only.

## Compatibility
This modification is compatible with:
- Grand Theft Auto: Vice City version 1.0
- Vice City: Multiplayer *up to* version 0.3z R2

*No other versions are supported.*

## Installation steps
- Download the mod (`MouseSensAdj.zip`) from the [**Releases** page](https://github.com/sfwidde/gta-vc-mouse-sensitivity-adjuster/releases/latest).
- Extract the **.zip** file contents to your game's root directory.

## Configure your mouse sensitivity
### `MouseSensAdj.txt` configuration file
- `mouse_x`
	- **Description:** Horizontal mouse sensitivity (x-axis).
	- **Acceptable values:** Any floating-point greater than or equal to 0.0.
	- **Defaults to:** 0.0
- `mouse_y`
	- **Description:** Vertical mouse sensitivity (y-axis).
	- **Acceptable values:** Any floating-point greater than or equal to 0.0.
	- **Defaults to:** 1.2
- `trigger_key`
	- **Description:** Key to press to apply the above sensitivity values
	in-game.
	- **Acceptable values:** Any of those on this list (except `VK_F10`):

	- **Defaults to:** 0x78 (`VK_F9`) (F9 key)

As mentioned above, `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` values are interchangeable with
those of version 0.4 of VC:MP (`game_sensitivity` and `game_sensitivity_ratio`
respectively). For instance, a value of 0.5 for `mouse_y` will not set y-axis
sensitivity to 0.5 but will instead set it to half the value of `mouse_x`.

Values in the configuration file can be modified whilst in-game. Hit
`trigger_key` key to apply changes.
